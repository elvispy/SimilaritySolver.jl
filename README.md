# Symbolic Similarity PDE Solver (Julia)

This Julia package provides a set of tools for symbolic manipulation and similarity transformation of partial differential equations (PDEs). It is built on top of the `Symbolics.jl` and `SymbolicUtils.jl` ecosystems and supports automatic classification of variables, similarity analysis, boundary condition parsing, and ODE reduction.

---

## üß† Motivation

Similarity solutions are a powerful technique for reducing partial differential equations (PDEs) to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This simplification often makes complex analytical or numerical problems more tractable. However, identifying appropriate transformations and substitutions is nontrivial.

This package automates that process by:
- Classifying symbolic variables as inputs or outputs
- Substituting similarity variables
- Applying heuristics to guess transformation powers
- Verifying and simplifying the reduced equation

This tool aims to accelerate mathematical modeling in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automatic decomposition** of symbolic variables into inputs and outputs.
- **Similarity transformation detection** for 2D PDEs.
- **Boundary condition parsing** and transformation under similarity variables.
- **Power guessing heuristic** for identifying simplifying substitutions.
- **Parsing PDEs from strings** using symbolic differential notation like `d2x/dy`.

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

Dependencies include:
- `Symbolics`

## üîß Usage Example

### Find Similarity Solution

```julia
using Symbolics

result = find_similarity("du/dt + 6 * u * du/dx + d3u/d3x = 0", "u(x=Inf, t) = 0")
println(result)
```

### Parse Boundary Conditions

```julia
bc = "f(x=0, t) = 1.0"
parsed = parse_boundary_condition(bc)
println(parsed[1]["function"])
println(parsed[1]["restriction"])
println(parsed[1]["value"])
```

### Parse a PDE String

```julia
parse_pde("d2x/dy = x * y", [:x, :y], [:u])
```

## üî§ Notation and Syntax

The core function `find_ode` and its wrapper `find_similarity` expect PDEs and boundary conditions in a symbolic or string-based format. Here‚Äôs how the notation works:

### PDE Expression Syntax
- Use `d<order><variable>` for partial derivatives.
- Use `/` to indicate the variable of differentiation.
- Use `=` to denote equality (internally rewritten as `- RHS`).

Example:
```julia
"du/dt + 6 * u * du/dx + d3u/d3x = 0"
```
will be interpreted as:
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + 6u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial x^3} = 0 \]

### Boundary Condition Syntax
Boundary conditions must be passed as a semicolon-separated string of assignments:
```julia
"u(x=0, t) = 1.0; u(x=Inf, t) = 0"
```
Each condition defines the function, input restrictions, and its fixed value.

### Variable Decomposition
Variables are automatically split into:
- **Inputs** (e.g. `x`, `y`) ‚Äî variables others depend on
- **Outputs** (e.g. `u(x,y)`) ‚Äî variables defined as functions of inputs

The code then attempts similarity substitutions of the form:
\[ \eta = y x^m \quad \text{and} \quad u(x, y) = y^n f(\eta) \]
and tries to find powers \( n, m \) that reduce the PDE.
